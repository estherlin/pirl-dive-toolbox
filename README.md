# pirl-dive-toolbox
The pirl-dive-toolbox is a collection of Python scripts written over my 8-month internship with the PIRL-DIVE team in the Atomically Resolved Dynamics Group in the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter from May-Dec. 2018. The predominant theme of this repository is image processing. There are functions for the analysis of interference and plume images. 

## Getting Started
The following instructions will set up a copy of the project on your local machine for development or usage. 

### Prerequisites
To use this toolbox, you'll need conda installed on your computer. Then, create an environment with all of the toolbox dependencies listed in `environment.yml`. The default environment name is `pirl-dive`. To change this, change the name in the first line in the `yml` file. For environment installation and usage, use Terminal or Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:
1. Create the environment from `environment.yml`: ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
2. To use the environment, it needs to be activated: 
    - Windows: `activate pirl-dive`
    - macOS and Linuz: `source activate pirl-dive`
3. To deactivate the environment:
    - Windows: `deactivate`
    - macOS and Linuz: `source deactivate`

### Install
To download the the most updated version as a zip archive:
1. Navigate to the [project page](https://github.com/estherlin/pirl-dive-toolbox)
